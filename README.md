# Machine Failure Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting machine failures using machine learning techniques. By analyzing sensor data and operational parameters, we aim to detect early signs of potential failures, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identification of key factors contributing to machine failures.
- Statistical and graphical analysis of failure trends across different operating conditions.
- Machine learning models to predict failures based on available sensor data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** for data analysis and modeling
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning model building
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis

## 📂 Project Files
- `Thanuja Machine Failure Prediction Jupyter Notebook.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis.
- `train_MachineFailure.csv`, `test_MachineFailure.csv` - Machine failure dataset used for analysis.
